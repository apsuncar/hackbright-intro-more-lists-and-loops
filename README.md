# More Lists and Loops

## Fork and Clone

First make a fork of this repository.  Make sure you are on your fork rather than still on this page, and then clone the repository to your local computer.

I suggest giving your pair collaboration rights rather than making a separate fork for them.  If you prefer making a separate fork to share your work, wait until you have completed the exercises to do so!

## Exercise 1: More Lists

Go to the [prime lists directory](https://github.com/salogel42/hackbright-intro-more-lists-and-loops/blob/master/list-primes/list-primes.md) for instructions.  I suggest viewing it on GitHub rather than opening it locally (the formattting looks better on GitHub).
