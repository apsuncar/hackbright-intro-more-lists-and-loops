# More Lists and Loops

## Fork and Clone

First make a fork of this repository.  Make sure you are on your fork rather than still on this page, and then clone the repository to your local computer.

I suggest giving your pair collaboration rights rather than making a separate fork for them.  If you prefer making a separate fork to share your work, wait until you have completed the exercises and pushed your code back to the fork to do so!

## Activity 1: More Lists

Go to the [prime lists directory](https://github.com/salogel42/hackbright-intro-more-lists-and-loops/blob/master/01-list-primes/list-primes.md) for instructions.  I suggest viewing it on GitHub rather than opening it locally (the formattting looks better on GitHub).

## Activity 2: Range and For loops

Start with the [range exercise])(https://github.com/salogel42/hackbright-intro-more-lists-and-loops/blob/master/02-range-and-loops/01-range.md) and then move on to the [for loop exercise](https://github.com/salogel42/hackbright-intro-more-lists-and-loops/blob/master/02-range-and-loops/02-for-loops.md).
